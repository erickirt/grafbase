## Breaking changes

- It shouldn't any production impact, but now `@inaccessible` consistency is enforced by the gateway. If an required argument has an inaccessible type, the parent field/input object will be inaccessible as a client it's not possible to construct a valid operation with it. Object, interfaces and input objects without fields, and unions without members will also be marked as inaccessible.

## Fixes

- When authentication extensions are active, the Gateway would previously return 401 responses instead of 404 on unauthenticated requests to routes that do not exist. It now returns 404 responses. (https://github.com/grafbase/grafbase/pull/3296)
- Use the configured GraphQL & MCP path patterns in the config rather than the URL for OpenTelemetry metrics.
- Wasm extensions would not share state correctly between instances.

## Changes

- The MCP endpoint is now also fully protected with authentication extensions. Before, it was possible to use `search` and `introspect` tools. And `execute` wouldn't return the appropriate status code.
- MCP and GraphQL endpoints can be configured to have different authentication extensions applied, but also a different default behavior:

```toml
[authentication.protected_resources.mcp]
extensions = ["auth1"]
default = "anonymous"

[authentication.protected_resources.graphql]
extensions = ["auth2"]
```
