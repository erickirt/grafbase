## Features

- Header rules patterns, applied on header names, are now case insensitive.
- Expose Grafbase telemetry configuration in gateway. The configuration is the same as `telemetry.exporters.otlp`. For example to use the HTTP protocol rather than gRPC:

```toml
[telemetry.grafbase]
# Instead of "GRAFBASE_OTEL_URL" env var you can now specify it in the configuration:
endpoint = "..."
protocol = "http"
```

## Bug fixes

- Using --graph-ref with a graph ref containing a branch that has slashes or other special characters in its name now works as expected, instead of behaving as if the branch did not exist.
- Fixed a panic when using resolver extensions with non-virtual subgraphs (subgraphs with URLs). Resolver extensions now properly validate that they can only be used with virtual subgraphs and return a clear error message instead of panicking.
- Various bug fixes with `FieldSelectionMap` from the Composite Schemas spec.
