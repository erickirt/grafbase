## Breaking changes

- Dropped support for the native JWT authentication `authentication.providers`. Use the [jwt](https://grafbase.com/extensions/jwt) extension instead.
- Dropped support for the `@authenticated` & `@requiresScopes` directives. Use the [authenticated](https://grafbase.com/extensions/authenticated) and [requires-scopes](https://grafbase.com/extensions/requires-scopes) extensions instead.
