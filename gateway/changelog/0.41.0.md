## Breaking changes

- Legacy hooks are not supported anymore, instead the SDK 0.17 provides a Hook extension.

## Features

- Support for SDK 0.17 which adds a new resolver & hooks extension types replacing their legacy counterparts.

## Improvements

- The opt-in MCP server now takes HTTP headers into account when executing requests. For example, you can now configure your MCP client to send the `Authorization` header with a token as would be expected by the gateway, and the MCPÂ server will pass on the header, allowing it to execute authenticated requests.
- The gateway now caches the compiled WebAssembly extensions into a `cache` directory, within the `grafbase_extensions` folder where extensions are installed or at their location if a path is provided.
