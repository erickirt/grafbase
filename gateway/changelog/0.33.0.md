## Breaking changes

- Removed previously introduced `graph.schema-fetch-url` parameter.

## Features

- Adding a opt-in MCP server with the following default options:

```toml
[mcp]
enabled = false
path = "/mcp"
include_mutations = false
```

You can include it in tools like Cursor with the following configuration locally:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-api": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
