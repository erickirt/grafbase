## Improvements

- During composition, all subgraph validation errors are now collected and displayed together instead of failing on the first error. Each error is prefixed with the subgraph name for clarity.
- Many improvements to the graphql-schema-validation and graphql-composition crates included in this CLI. See their respective changelogs for details.

## Fix

- Would not load correctly the SDK 0.21 in `grafbase dev`
