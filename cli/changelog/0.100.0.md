## Features

- Add `--listen-address` to the dev command.

## Breaking changes

- for the `dev` command, if `network.listen_address` is configured in the `grafbase.toml` and neither `-p/--port` nor `--listen-address` are provided, it is used as is. Previously only the port would be used, and server would bind on `127.0.0.1`.

## Fixes

- Fix schema page in `dev` command
