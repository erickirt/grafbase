## Changes

- Previously `grafbase introspect` header option `--header/-H` would accept multiple arguments in the form of `-H 'name: value' 'name2: value2' ..`. It wasn't a natural use of the option though and led to confusing message with `-H 'Authorization: ...' <url>` saying that no URL was provided. So the header option can should be used multiple times instead now: `-H 'name: value' -H 'name2: value2'`
