[authorization]
# Directives that need to granted authorization during execution. Every other directive will be treated as metadata only.
# Defaults to all defined directives.

# directives = ["myAuth"]

# Refine the grouping used by the gateway for authorization. By default, the gateway will request authorization only once for
# any decorated element (ex: field), independent of its location in the query, from which subgraph it comes from 
# and how many times it appears in the query.
#
# Supported values include:
# - `subgraph`: The gateway will request authorization for each subgraph that contains the decorated element.
#
# Defaults to empty list.

group_by = ["subgraph"]
