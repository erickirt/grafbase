# Changes

- Improved documentation
- Cleaned up the root namespace, most types are in `types::` now.
- Moved `host::Headers` to `types::Headers`
- Removed `http::StatusCode` from re-export and added a `unauthorized()`, `forbidden()`, `bad_request()`
  and removed the error argument for `internal_server_error` or `ErrorResponse`.
- Renamed `FieldOutput` to `FieldOutputs` for consistency with `FieldInputs`.
