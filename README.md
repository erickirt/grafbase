## **What is Grafbase?**

Grafbase is a self-hosted, Rust-powered GraphQL Federation Gateway designed for high-scale, mission-critical applications. Whether you're unifying microservices, legacy systems, or third-party APIsâ€”Grafbase helps teams ship faster and more safely.

### **Built for GraphQL Federation 2.0**

* **Federation-first architecture** â€” Native support for Apollo Federation 2.0 specification and the upcoming Composite Schemas spec  
* **40% faster performance** â€” Rust-powered engine delivers superior speed vs Apollo alternatives  
* **Extensible via WebAssembly** â€” Customize authentication, authorization, request lifecycle, and include arbitrary APIs and data sources into your federated graph with resolver extensions  
* **AI-native with MCP** â€” First GraphQL gateway with built-in Model Context Protocol server support to turn your GraphQL API into a full fledged MCP server

## **Why choose Grafbase for GraphQL Federation?**

### **Superior performance**

Grafbase delivers up to 40% faster response times vs Apollo and other gateways with lower memory usage and CPU consumption. Built in Rust for maximum efficiency.

### **Enterprise-grade security**

* Advanced schema governance with the Grafbase control plane at grafbase.com, with schema checks  
* Fine-grained authorization and authentication in the Gateway  
* Rate limiting, operation limits, and trusted documents  
* SOC 2 Type II compliant

### **Flexible deployment options for the Enterprise Platform**

* **Self-hosted**: Full control in your infrastructure  
* **Managed Cloud**: Grafbase-hosted  
* **Air-gapped**: Offline deployments for high-security environments

The Gateway itself is always 100% self hosted.

### **Universal data integration**

Connect any data source through GraphQL Federation:

* GraphQL [subgraphs](https://grafbase.com/docs/gateway/configuration/subgraph-configuration)  
* [REST APIs](https://grafbase.com/extensions/rest)  
* [gRPC services](https://grafbase.com/extensions/grpc)  
* Databases ([Postgres](https://grafbase.com/extensions/postgres), [Snowflake](https://grafbase.com/extensions/snowflake))  
* Message queues ([Kafka](https://grafbase.com/extensions/kafka), [NATS](https://grafbase.com/extensions/nats))  
* Custom protocols and data sources via [WebAssembly extensions](https://grafbase.com/docs/gateway/extensions)

## Repository overview

This repository contains the core open source components of Grafbase: the CLI, the Gateway and supporting libraries. See the [grafbase/extensions](https://github.com/grafbase/extensions) repository for our open source extensions.

## **ðŸš€ Quick start**

### Prerequisites

* Node.js installed if you want to install via npm  
* Grafbase CLI installed: `npm install -g grafbase` or `curl -fsSL https://grafbase.com/downloads/cli | bash`  
* Grafbase account (sign up at https://grafbase.com)

### 1\. Create your first subgraph

```shell
# Create a simple accounts subgraph
mkdir accounts && cd accounts
npm init -y
npm install graphql-yoga @apollo/subgraph graphql

# Create index.js
cat > index.js << 'EOF'
import { createSchema, createYoga } from "graphql-yoga";
import { buildSubgraphSchema } from "@apollo/subgraph";
import { createServer } from "http";

const users = [
  { id: "1", email: "john@example.com", username: "john_doe" },
  { id: "2", email: "bob@example.com", username: "bob_dole" },
];

const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    users: [User!]!
  }
  
  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    email: String!
    username: String!
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    users: () => users,
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference: (reference) => {
      return users.find(user => user.id === reference.id);
    },
  },
};

const schema = buildSubgraphSchema([{ typeDefs, resolvers }]);
const yoga = createYoga({ schema });
const server = createServer(yoga);

server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('ðŸš€ Accounts subgraph ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql');
});
EOF

# Start the subgraph
node index.js
```

### 2\. Set up local federation

In a new terminal, create your federation configuration:

```shell
# Create federation directory
mkdir my-federation && cd my-federation

# Create grafbase.toml configuration
cat > grafbase.toml << 'EOF'
[subgraphs.accounts]
introspection_url = "http://localhost:4000/graphql"
EOF

# Start local federated development server
grafbase dev
```

Your federated graph will be available at:

* **GraphQL Endpoint**: http://localhost:5000/graphql  
* **Explorer**: http://localhost:5000/

### 4\. Deploy to production using the schema registry

### **Note:** you can also compose the schema locally and pass it to the gateway directly, without any log in or remote component

#### Create a graph in Grafbase Dashboard

1. Visit https://grafbase.com and create/login to your account  
2. Create a new federated graph  
3. Copy your graph reference (format: `my-org/my-graph`)

#### Publish your subgraph

```shell
# Login to Grafbase (one-time setup)
grafbase login

# Publish the accounts subgraph
grafbase introspect http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  | grafbase publish \
    --name accounts \
    --url http://localhost:4000/graphql \
    --message "Initial accounts subgraph" \
    my-org/my-graph
```

#### Deploy the gateway

```shell
# Install Grafbase Gateway
curl -fsSL https://grafbase.com/downloads/gateway | bash

# Create access token in your Grafbase Dashboard under Settings > Access Tokens

# Start production gateway
GRAFBASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here ./grafbase-gateway \
  --config grafbase.toml \
  --graph-ref my-org/my-graph
```

### Next Steps

* Add more subgraphs following the same pattern  
* Configure authentication and authorization  
* Set up schema checks with `grafbase check`  
* Explore Extensions for connecting databases, gRPC services, and more

* [gRPC Services](https://grafbase.com/changelog/grpc-extension) \- Protocol Buffer service integration  
* [WASM Extensions](https://grafbase.com/docs/features/extensions) \- Custom authentication, authorization, resolvers and request lifecycle hooks

## **Extending with WebAssembly**

Grafbase supports powerful customization via WebAssembly extensions:

```
# Create a custom authentication extension
grafbase extension init --type authentication auth-guard
cd auth-guard

# Build and install
grafbase extension build
grafbase extension install
```

**Extension Use Cases:**

* **Custom Authentication** \- JWT validation, API key management  
* **Custom Authorization**\- implement arbitrary authorization business logic, declaratively requiring data from the graph  
* **Arbitrary resolvers â€” plug your non-GraphQL APIs and data sources in your federated graph without writing and deploying any additional GraphQL server**   
* **Observability Hooks** \- Custom logging and metrics collection  
* **Rate Limiting** \- Advanced throttling and quota management

## **Self-hosted Gateway Deployment**

The Grafbase Gateway allows you to run a federated graph within your own infrastructure and can operate by either polling the latest graph from the Grafbase API or by passing the federated schema, enabling air-gapped operation.

### **Installation**

To install the Grafbase Gateway, run the following command:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://grafbase.com/downloads/gateway | bash
```

### **Deployment Modes**

**Hybrid Mode** (Connected to Grafbase Cloud): Start the gateway in hybrid mode with the graph reference and an organization access token:

```shell
GRAFBASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=token ./grafbase-gateway \
  --config grafbase.toml \
  --graph-ref graph@branch
```

**Air-gapped Mode** (Fully self-contained): Start the gateway in air-gapped mode with a local schema file:

```shell
./grafbase-gateway \
  --config /path/to/grafbase.toml \
  --schema /path/to/federated-schema.graphql \
  --listen-address 127.0.0.1:4000
```

**Docker Deployment**:

```shell
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
  -v $(pwd)/grafbase.toml:/etc/grafbase.toml \
  -v $(pwd)/schema.graphql:/etc/schema.graphql \
  ghcr.io/grafbase/gateway:latest \
  --config /etc/grafbase.toml \
  --schema /etc/schema.graphql
```

### **Gateway Features**

* JWT authentication and federated authorization  
* Rate limiting, operation limits, and trusted documents  
* Entity caching and automatic persisted queries  
* Health check endpoints and request lifecycle hooks  
* OpenTelemetry integration for logs, traces, and metrics  
* â€¦ and many more (link)
