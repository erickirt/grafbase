## **What is Grafbase?**

Grafbase is a self-hosted, Rust-powered GraphQL Federation Gateway designed for high-scale, mission-critical applications. Whether you're unifying microservices, legacy systems, or third-party APIsâ€”Grafbase helps teams ship faster and more safely.

### **Built for Federation v2**

* **Federation-first architecture** â€” Native support for Apollo Federation v2 specification and the upcoming Composite Schemas spec  
* **40% faster performance** â€” Rust-powered engine delivers superior speed  
* **Extensible via WebAssembly** â€” Customize authentication, authorization, request lifecycle, and include arbitrary APIs and data sources into your federated graph with resolver extensions  
* **AI-native with MCP** â€” First GraphQL gateway with built-in Model Context Protocol server support to turn your GraphQL API into a full fledged MCP server

## **Why choose Grafbase for GraphQL Federation?**

### **Superior performance**

Grafbase delivers up to 40% faster response times vs Apollo and other gateways with lower memory usage and CPU consumption. Built in Rust for maximum efficiency.

### **Enterprise-grade security**

* Advanced schema governance with the Grafbase Dashboard at app.grafbase.com, with schema checks  
* Fine-grained authorization and authentication in the Gateway  
* Rate limiting, operation limits, and trusted documents  
* SOC 2 Type II compliant

### **Flexible deployment options for the Enterprise Platform**

* **Self-hosted**: Full control in your infrastructure  
* **Managed Cloud**: Grafbase-hosted  
* **Air-gapped**: Offline deployments for high-security environments

The Gateway itself is always 100% self hosted.

### **Universal data integration**

Connect any data source through GraphQL Federation:

* GraphQL [subgraphs](https://grafbase.com/docs/gateway/configuration/subgraph-configuration)  
* [REST APIs](https://grafbase.com/extensions/rest)  
* [gRPC services](https://grafbase.com/extensions/grpc)  
* Databases ([Postgres](https://grafbase.com/extensions/postgres), [Snowflake](https://grafbase.com/extensions/snowflake))  
* Message queues ([Kafka](https://grafbase.com/extensions/kafka), [NATS](https://grafbase.com/extensions/nats))  
* Custom protocols and data sources via [WebAssembly extensions](https://grafbase.com/docs/gateway/extensions)

**Core features**

| Apollo Federation v2 | Native support for Apollo Federation v2 spec |
| **Rust-Powered Gateway** | Ultra-low latency and memory efficiency at enterprise scale |
| **Extensions** | Customize auth, transforms, and business logic without gateway modifications |
| **Schema Governance Platform** | Composition checks, breaking change detection, and approval workflows with schema proposals (in the control plane) |
| **Branch Environments Platform** | Schema versioning and branch-aware development environments (in the control plane) |
| **CLI & Gateway** | Complete toolchain for development, deployment, and management |
| **MCP Integration** | Built-in Model Context Protocol support to efficiently expose your GraphQL API as an MCP server with a few lines of configuration |
| **Observability (in the Platform)** | Traces, metrics, logs, and operation analytics |

## Repository overview

This repository contains the core open source components of Grafbase: the CLI, the Gateway and supporting libraries. See the [grafbase/extensions](https://github.com/grafbase/extensions) repository for our open source extensions.

## **ðŸš€ Quick start**

Get started quickly with Grafbase by following our [getting started guide](https://grafbase.com/guides/introduction-to-graphql-federation).

## **Examples & templates**

Explore real-world implementations and integration patterns in our [examples](https://github.com/grafbase/grafbase/tree/main/examples) directory:

**Learn more:**

* [gRPC Services](https://grafbase.com/changelog/grpc-extension) \- Protocol Buffer service integration  
* [WASM Extensions](https://grafbase.com/docs/features/extensions) \- Custom authentication, authorization, resolvers and request lifecycle hooks

## **Extending with WebAssembly**

Grafbase supports powerful customization via WebAssembly extensions:

```
# Create a custom authentication extension
grafbase extension init --type authentication auth-guard
cd auth-guard

# Build and install
grafbase extension build
grafbase extension install
```

**Extension Use Cases:**

* **Custom Authentication** \- JWT validation, API key management  
* **Custom Authorization**\- implement arbitrary authorization business logic, declaratively requiring data from the graph  
* **Arbitrary resolvers â€” plug your non-GraphQL APIs and data sources in your federated graph without writing and deploying any additional GraphQL server**   
* **Observability Hooks** \- Custom logging and metrics collection  
* **Rate Limiting** \- Advanced throttling and quota management

### **Installation**

To install the Grafbase Gateway, run the following command:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://grafbase.com/downloads/gateway | bash
```

### **Deployment Modes**

**Hybrid Mode** (Connected to Grafbase Cloud): Start the gateway in hybrid mode with the graph reference and an organization access token:

```shell
GRAFBASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=token ./grafbase-gateway \
  --config grafbase.toml \
  --graph-ref graph@branch
```

**Air-gapped Mode** (Fully self-contained): Start the gateway in air-gapped mode with a local schema file:

```shell
./grafbase-gateway \
  --config /path/to/grafbase.toml \
  --schema /path/to/federated-schema.graphql \
  --listen-address 127.0.0.1:4000
```

**Docker Deployment**:

```shell
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
  -v $(pwd)/grafbase.toml:/etc/grafbase.toml \
  -v $(pwd)/schema.graphql:/etc/schema.graphql \
  ghcr.io/grafbase/gateway:latest \
  --config /etc/grafbase.toml \
  --schema /etc/schema.graphql
```
