2. Pre-allocate HashMaps with Capacity

Multiple HashMaps are created without capacity hints (lines 65-69, 77-78).

Solution:
let node_count = graph.node_count();
let mut reached_vertices = HashMap::with_capacity(node_count);
let mut flow_rates = HashMap::with_capacity(node_count);

3. Optimize Terminal Feeding Lookups

The nested HashMap structure feeding_terminals: HashMap<NodeIndex, HashMap<NodeIndex, bool>> causes cache misses.

Solution: Use a BitSet or packed representation:
// Use bit flags for terminal feeding status
struct TerminalFlags(u64); // Supports up to 64 terminals

4. Reduce Heap Reconstruction

Lines 195-204 drain and rebuild the entire heap just to update some nodes.

Solution: Use a lazy deletion approach with versioning:
struct FibonacciNode {
saturate_time: f64,
edge: Edge,
version: usize, // Track if this entry is still valid
}

5. Cache Reached Vertices

The recursive collect_reached_vertices (lines 235-251) recomputes the same sets repeatedly.

Solution: Implement path compression or maintain incremental updates:
// Update reached vertices incrementally when edges are added
fn update_reached_incrementally(&mut self, edge: Edge) {
let src_reached = self.reached_vertices[&edge.src].clone();
self.reached_vertices.get_mut(&edge.dst).unwrap().extend(src_reached);
}

6. Optimize is_flow_degenerate

The O(|reached| × |terminals|) check at lines 146-155 can be improved.

Solution: Use early termination with bit operations:
fn is_flow_degenerate(&self, v: NodeIndex, reached: &HashSet<NodeIndex>) -> bool {
let v_terminals = self.terminal_flags[&v];
reached.iter().any(|&w| {
(self.terminal_flags[&w] & v_terminals) != 0
})
}

The `engine-query-solver` crate contains an algorithm in `crates/engine/query-solver/src/solve/solver.rs` that finds a solution for a Steiner Tree problem that has dynamic edge costs. The underlying Steiner tree algorithm is implemented today by ShortestPathAlgorithm in the `algorithm` attribute. In the `execute()` function you'll see that the algorithm is called multiple times, each on adding new nodes to the steiner tree. The goal is to handle dependencies that are only necessary if certain paths are taken. So if node A is taken, we need to add A_2, but if we took B we A_2 would no be part of the terminals.

First of all, summarize the logic in the Solver and how it interacts with the ShortestPathAlgorithm in `crates/engine/query-solver/src/solve/shortest_path/mod.rs`.

The Solver implements a dynamic Steiner Tree algorithm for finding optimal query resolution paths in GraphQL. Here's how it works:

Core Problem

The solver addresses a Steiner Tree problem with dynamic edge costs based on dispensable requirements. The key challenge is that some nodes (requirements) are only needed if
certain paths are taken through the graph.

Key Components

1. Solver (solver.rs):

   - Manages the overall solving process
   - Handles dispensable requirements metadata
   - Coordinates cost updates based on path-dependent requirements
   - Orchestrates the iterative solving process

2. ShortestPathAlgorithm (shortest_path/mod.rs):

   - Implements the actual Steiner Tree construction
   - Maintains shortest paths from root to all nodes
   - Handles incremental terminal additions
   - Manages cost updates and path recalculations

3. ShortestPathSteinerTree (shortest_path/tree.rs):

   - Tracks which nodes are in the Steiner tree
   - Maintains shortest path costs and incoming edges
   - Implements tree growth operations

Algorithm Flow

1.  Initialization:

    - Identifies initial terminals (query fields marked as LEAF_NODE and INDISPENSABLE)
    - Builds a filtered graph containing only relevant nodes/edges
    - Populates dispensable requirements metadata
    - Performs initial cost calibration

2.  Iterative Execution (execute() method):
    loop {
    // Grow tree to include more terminals
    let has_terminals_left = self.algorithm.continue_steiner_tree_growth();

        // Update costs based on new requirements
        let added_new_terminals = self.cost_fixed_point_iteration()?;

        // Stop if no terminals left and no new ones added
        if !has_terminals_left && !added_new_terminals {
            break;
        }

    }

3.  Dynamic Cost Updates:

    - When a node with dispensable requirements is added to the tree, its requirements become indispensable
    - Edge costs are adjusted to reflect the cost of satisfying these requirements
    - Uses fixed-point iteration to stabilize costs

4.  Tree Growth Strategy:

    - Prioritizes zero-cost terminals first
    - Adds at least one non-zero cost terminal per iteration
    - Updates shortest paths after each growth phase
    - Handles cascading zero-cost additions

Key Interactions

- Solver → ShortestPathAlgorithm:
  - continue_steiner_tree_growth(): Advances tree construction
  - insert_edge_cost_update(): Queues edge cost changes
  - apply_all_cost_updates(): Applies pending cost changes
  - estimate_extra_cost(): Calculates requirement costs for path evaluation
  - extend_terminals(): Adds new required nodes based on chosen paths
- ShortestPathAlgorithm → ShortestPathSteinerTree:
  - grow_with_some_terminals(): Adds terminals and updates paths
  - update_shortest_paths(): Recalculates shortest paths after changes
  - node_addition_cost(): Gets cost to add a node to current tree

The algorithm elegantly handles the dynamic nature of the problem where choosing certain paths creates new requirements, which in turn affects the optimal solution. The
iterative approach with cost updates ensures that the final Steiner tree considers all path-dependent requirements while minimizing total cost.

After analyzing the FLAC algorithm more carefully, I realize it's designed to work backwards - from terminals towards the root. The issue is that it expects a graph where you
can reach the root FROM the terminals, not the other way around.

Since we're working with a DAG where edges go from root to terminals, we need to adapt our approach. Let me create a simpler implementation that just uses the original Greedy
FLAC approach without trying to match the exact API:
